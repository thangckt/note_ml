    "The value of the definite integral represents the (net) area under the curve of the graph of $y=f(x)$ on the interval $[a,b]$. The term \"net\" means that area above the x-axis is positive and the area under the x-axis counts as negative area.\n",

    "Simpson's rule uses a quadratic polynomial on each subinterval of a partition to approximate the function $f(x)$ and to compute the definite integral. This is an improvement over the trapezoid rule which approximates $f(x)$ by a straight line on each subinterval of a partition.\n",
